					<p className="mt-2 text-base leading-7 text-gray-600">
						While I am not doing job, I write code. I love building softwares. I am a full stack developer with great
						knowledge on both frontend and backend frameworks. I have around 4 years of experience in{" "}
						<strong>Flutter</strong>, and around 3 years of experience in <strong>Nodejs</strong>,{" "}
						<strong>Express</strong>, <strong>React</strong>, <strong>NestJS</strong> and some other javascript
						frameworks.

						I also know <strong>Java</strong>, I use java when I am doing DSA or competitive programming. I also have
						working experience in <strong>Spring Boot</strong>. Don't have much projects in Spring boot to showcase, but
						I did Spring Boot during my internship at Capgemini.

					<p className="mt-2 text-base leading-7 text-gray-600">
						Now, coming to Competitive programming and DSA. I am not a super fan of DSA, I like development more. But
						sooner or later, you figure out that DSA is as important as Development. I am in that phase now. So I am
						trying to be consistent, I try to solve leetcode problems, watch tutorials, read blogs on algorithms. I am
						progressing, it's slow, but I'll be there.

					<p className="mt-2 text-base leading-7 text-gray-600">
						I'm passionate about taking on new challenges and explaining complex problems and solutions to my team.
						Writing code is something I could do all day, and I find immense satisfaction in breaking down tasks into
						modular components, ticking them off one by one. It's all about making progress, no matter how small, and I
						don't give up easily when things don't work as expected.

					<h3 className="text-xl font-semibold tracking-tight text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">My Negatives</h3>
					<p className="mt-2 text-base leading-7 text-gray-600">
						While I enjoy working in an organized and structured environment, flexibility can sometimes be my nemesis. I
						struggle with consistency when things aren't clearly defined, and I find it difficult to make decisions when
						I lack context. However, I'm driven by growth—both personal and professional. I believe in being better than
						yesterday, and I feel frustrated when I'm not performing up to my potential.

						In terms of reading, I've recently read <strong>Atomic Habits</strong>, <strong>Psychology of Money</strong>
						, and <strong>The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck</strong>. Outside of work, I enjoy playing football,
						dabbling in finance, and spending time with a few close friends. And yes, I code even on weekends — it's not
						just a job, it's a passion.
